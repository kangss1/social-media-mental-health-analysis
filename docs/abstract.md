# Abstract

This project explores the relationship between social media usage patterns and mental health outcomes among adults, using a survey dataset collected from social media users. The analysis focuses on two key behavioral variables—time spent on social media and purposeless usage—and their associations with depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and distractibility. Using R for data cleaning, statistical modeling, and visualization, we found moderate but statistically significant positive correlations between time spent online and mental health symptoms. Purposeless social media use emerged as a stronger predictor of psychological distress, particularly in relation to distraction and depression. These findings suggest that both the quantity and quality of social media engagement influence mental well-being, underscoring the importance of mindful digital habits and self-regulation in online behavior.
