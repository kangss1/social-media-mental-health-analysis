We would like to express our sincere gratitude to **Instructor Ashley Miller (M.S. Data Science, B.S. Marketing)**  
for her continuous support, insightful feedback, and expert guidance throughout the duration of this course.

This research and accompanying analysis were collaboratively conducted by the project team members  
listed in the final report. Each member contributed equally to data preparation, statistical analysis,  
visualization design, and documentation.

We also acknowledge the open-source R community and the developers of **`tidyverse`**, **`ggplot2`**,  
and **`corrplot`**, whose tools enabled the analytical and visualization components of this project.
